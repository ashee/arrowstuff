= Flatbuffers

This is a project for me to spelunk flatbuffers.
It includes integration of mvn support for flatc

flatbuffer files included in src/main/fbs is automatically run through flatc.
Generated code is then compiled with application specific java code.

= Build instructions

```
$ mvn package
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.ashee.SampleBinary
```
